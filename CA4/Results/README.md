## Results
* `Results/p1a.png` - Shows difference between smooth image and sharp image Fourier Transforms; smooth image produces an impulse, while sharp image produces a sinc wave
* `Results/p1b.png` - Shows low- and high-frequency images and their associated FTs; explains frequency graphically
* `Results/p1c.png` - Introduces 2D Fourier Transforms by alternating both X and Y values; sharp edges produce 1D and 2D sinc waves
* `Results/p2.png` - Shows frequency content of US and UK flags; patterns can be observed in different directions dependent on the directions of the flags' lines
* `Results/p3.png` - Shows results of different power averaging filters on a picture of the moon
* `Results/p4a.png` - Shows result of turning high-pass 1D Butter filter into 2D filter and using it to edge-detect picture of moon
* `Results/p4b.png` - Shows two different filters smoothing noisy image; low-pass elliptical filter converted to 2D filter is poor compared to self-adjusting Wiener filter
